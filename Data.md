2) Paste the skin cancer dataset to the input file and unzip it,leave the no disease dataset in the downloads folder itself and    rename it as "nod". \
4) In the datatree directory, create a folder named "nod" in "train", "test" and "validation" \
5) he code goes in the src folder while the modelsgo in the outputN folder.
