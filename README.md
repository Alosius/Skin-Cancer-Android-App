Here are the Codes, Datasets and the Android App required to create the Skin Cancer Detection App.

## Process
The dataset is orignally availible at https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/DBW86T .
The given code uses inception_v3 at https://keras.io/applications/#inceptionv3.Inception model gave me a way better result compared to nasnetmobile and training the model was comparitively quick.
